Writing prompts for free writing.

Each line is an adjective noun and verb.

Try to use as many as you can in a free writing exercise for 15 minutes. Better yet try for flash fiction of 200+ words.

Currently the program will spit out two lines on the console and open 127.0.0.1:3333 for web requests.
